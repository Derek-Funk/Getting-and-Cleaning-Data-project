# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-project

The "run_analysis.R" file will create 2 major data sets of interest:
  1) "full_data" -> this is the result of merging the test and training data sets
  2) "full_data_2" -> this is the tidy data set that looks at the averages of all mean and std variables by subject/activity
 
 The "tidy data set.csv" is the file produced by "run_analysis.R".
